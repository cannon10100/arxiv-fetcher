# arxiv-fetcher
Small utility written in Rust to fetch recent papers from parts of Arxiv, storing their information. 

Will eventually be augmented with a UI, different users, etc. The goal of this project is to turn the effectively bottomless pit of new Arxiv papers into a personlized, finite, exhaustible stack.
